# MyKutupApp2

I have compiled five different books here and designed a table of contents for each one. The reader can easily return to the last section they read either by using the marker placed at the last read section or by using the button on the home page.

There is also a carefully designed 90-day tracker, as well as a reminder and a note feature to help build certain habits or similar goals.

This app is available on Google Play. You can download it from here:
